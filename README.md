Instruction

If you run script as is it will just get one transcript and save to html file.  If you set it to False it will download everything.  I haven't tried it on my computer as I've been doing multiple requests from my computer to that site already.   I tried different things and this worked best.  I uploaded it to my repo but if you would like to upload it somewhere else you are welcome to.
